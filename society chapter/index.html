                other
                activities that contribute to the electric power discipline or utilize the techniques or products within
                this
                discipline. The society sponsors various conferences throughout the year, including the PES General
                Meeting
                and
                the International Conference on Power Technology.

                PES members also gain access to the IEEE PES Resource Center, a library with hundreds of technical
                reports,
                tutorials, conference videos, webinars, presentations and more.

                PES also offers networking opportunities, access to peer-reviewed technical journals and educational
                materials
                that help our members stay-up-to date on the latest advances including renewable energy system design
                and
                integration, smart-grid technologies, electric vehicles, wholesale market design and operation and asset
                management.</p>
